xkcd-password-generator
=======================

A simple password generator inspired by XKCD - http://xkcd.com/936/

Run the script from the command-line, passing in a file containing the list of all possible words to use for password generation (the file doesn't need to be structured in any particular way - all non-letter characters will be removed, as will duplicate words).
